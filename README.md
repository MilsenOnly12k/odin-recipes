This project is to present the html skills I've aquired throught the TOP
foundations html course by creating a simple recipes website.

The skills I've possesed and will be using in this project come down to:
-creating ordered and unordered lists
-creating links and putting images into my webiste
-making text bold and emphasised 
-creating a simple paragraphs and headings

By completeing this project I'm going to be one step closer to becoming a
full-stack web dev :D
